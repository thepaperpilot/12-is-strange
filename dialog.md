###Ending 3

*Jefferson:"Again, Max I do wish you had submitted a photo. But luckily for me I have you 

all to myself. Too bad I'll have to kill you afterwards. I seriously wish it didn't have 

to be this way. If only you weren't so nosy."

*Maxine:"(internally("Okay Max. You can get out of here. You got this.))"

*Maxine:"My diary. You still have my diary."

hear this on your big day."

*Chloe:"No Max. Everyone is gone. My mom, step father are all gone. Just like the rest of

*David:"That high class know it all caught on. He ran off to either San Francisco or 

Seattle. He's on the run for now but we'll get him. The prescotts are under 

investigation. Damn punk Nathan talked and told me everything. But that's not is what is 

important now. What matters now is that you are all safe."

*David: "Don't thank me. You brought me here. You were right about Jefferson and the 

storm too. I gave the Emergency Services the heads up to evacuate the town. Everyone 

should be safe. I had the town siren sound off just before I left. No one should be there 

when the storm hits."

*Maxine:"And Chloe. Is she okay?"

*David:"She still calls me step douche but I told her about your warning. And thank God 

she listened for once. She was with her mom before I left. Call her and see for 

yourself."

Max calls Chloe. 

*Maxine:"Chloe, are you alright? Chloe, please pick up."

*Chloe:"Way to go Max. Yeah, I'm okay. Glad your time travel powers worked to save me yet 

again. If it weren't for you I'd probably be in the grave with Rachel Amber. I know 

you'll avenger. And Max, thanks for having me listen to David. Maybe I can stop calling 

him step-Furher for now on."

*Maxine:"We aren't going to save everyone but at least Jefferson and the Prescotts have 

been stopped."

over with. Let jet."
