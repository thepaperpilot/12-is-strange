**Theme:** 12

**Team:** Me & Dominic & Grant

Ideas:
12 endings

don't show what happened before the endings

but make the players make decisions anyways

each ending will help the player piece together what happened before the endings

3 choices: 2 options, 2 options, 3 options

Have a clock in the background, each ending a different hour

Gameplay:
point and click
each ending has items that help with the other endings
to win you need to "finish" each ending
persistent inventory
rewind to go to other endings

For story wise, just replicate Life is Strange
