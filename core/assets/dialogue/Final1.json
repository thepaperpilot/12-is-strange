I'm talking 10x the content, no 100x the content! Yeah, maybe even, like, 200x. I guess it just depends on how you measure content. Hopefully not based on # of clicks or something stupid."

Like, less sense than this fourth wall breaking cop out? Yeah, exactly. The point is, keep watching this game, because it's going to get, like, a lot better. A lot a lot. For now, Thanks for Playing!!"
