I'm talking 10x the content, no 100x the content! Yeah, maybe even, like, 200x. I guess it just depends on how you measure content. Hopefully not based on # of clicks or something stupid."

Like, less sense than this fourth wall breaking cop out? Yeah, exactly. The point is, keep watching this game, because it's going to get, like, a lot better. A lot a lot. For now, Thanks for Playing!!"

No worries, that'll change, I've already worked out how to structure the scenes such that I can reset them all pretty easily. But for now, do me a solid and press refresh or re-open the application or whatever it is you kids do these days, and pretend it happened automatically. Cool? Cool."
